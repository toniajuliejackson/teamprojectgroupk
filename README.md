DIT School of Computing requires a calendar application for the lecturing staff to keep track of their lectures, appointments and meetings. Functionality should include the following; • Lecturers enter and store details of lectures, appointments and meetings • Graphical User Interface should be used throughout the application • Access to their account over multiple devices it is installed on • One lecturer can see when another lecturer is available or busy without seeing the details of their appointments • Recurring appointments should be automated if desired!
